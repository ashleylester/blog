    <h4>Blog</h4>
    <p>I generally blog infrequently, but I like to post about a range of topics that interest me. This might be a review
      of a book about baduk (an ancient Chinese board game, also called weiqi, also commonly known to the West as go).
      Or, it might be something that I found interesting about a programming language, design pattern,
    web framework, or something about Artificial Intelligence. Or, it might just be about that delicious pork pie
    I had a week last Friday.</p>
